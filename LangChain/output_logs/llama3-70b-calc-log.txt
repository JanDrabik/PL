organize data into a table or list formatIt seems like you want to organize the previous questions and answers into a table or list format. Here's one way to do it:

**Table Format:**

| Question | Math Problem | Answer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 37593 * 67 | 2518731 |
| 2 | 37593^(1/5) | 8.222831614237718 |

**List Format:**

* Question 1: 37593 * 67 = 2518731
* Question 2: 37593^(1/5) = 8.222831614237718
