Thought:The search results provided some information about rental costs for 3-bedroom apartments in Bydgoszcz but did not provide specific data for 3-bedroom apartments in Lublin. The data is still incomplete for the task. Given the difficulty in obtaining specific rental cost data for 3-bedroom apartments in all required cities, I will compile the available data into a list format as requested, noting where data is missing.

Action:
```json

  "action": "Final Answer",
  "action_input": "Here is the compiled list of average rental costs for 1-bedroom and 3-bedroom apartments in the 10 largest cities in Poland as of 2024, based on the available data:\n\n1.
