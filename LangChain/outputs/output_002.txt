Top Real Estate Websites in Poland Ranking Analysis for May 2024. otodom.pl ranked number 1 and is the most visited Real Estate website in Poland in May 2024, followed by nieruchomosci-online.pl as the runner up, and adresowo.pl ranking at 3rd place as the leaders of the Real Estate websites in Poland. First of all, private rental can be settled according to the income tax bands in Poland (17% and 32% of income). The 17% rate applies to income not exceeding 85,528.00 PLN per year. Rental income is added to the income from other sources, for example, from an employment contract. Here's a ranking of the most frequented real estate portals in Poland as of April 2023: Otodom.pl - This site tops the list, pulling in a crowd of 67 million. I think it is worth saying, this is the go-to portal for real estate browsing in Poland. Gratka.pl - Not to be overshadowed, this portal drew a hefty 25 million visitors. The most expensive rent for a 45m2 apartment is 7,000zl. Granted, this is an insanely expensive exception to the rule. Moving down the list, expect to fork out around 3,200-4000zl for a cosy well-maintained 35-45m2 apartment. Rental fees of 2,500zl and below are generally for apartments in older buildings a long way out from the city centre.
